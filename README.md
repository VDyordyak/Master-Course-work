# Master-Course-work

In this coursework, I delved into client-server architecture by crafting a chat app. Using Python with Tkinter, Socket, and threading libraries, I explored communication dynamics. Opting for a centralized architecture, the server handled tasks like data storage and service delivery, while clients accessed resources. Within the chat app, the server managed message reception and distribution among clients, along with exit notifications.

To handle concurrent requests from multiple clients, I used Python's threading module. Each client connection was managed in its thread, allowing the server to process new connections and requests seamlessly. Leveraging a simple TCP/IP protocol, the app used Tkinter for client-side GUI and the socket module for server-side message handling.

Developing this app deepened my understanding of client-server systems and honed my Python skills. It showcased Python's efficiency in client-server interactions. Overall, the project provided valuable insights into network communication principles and practical experience with Python.
